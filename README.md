# Hack

This is a LaTEX source for Hack. 
Hack is an overview of penetration testing made by me. 
It includes many important and interesting tools as well as methodologies used by penetration testers.
The whole article/book is based on my own experience as a tester, in the book I describe and summarize methods that I personally
feel really important and usefull. This is the way I summarize my experience and try to share it with others.
Book can be used by begginers as a starting resource or by more experienced testers as addidional source of information as well as quick overview of used tools.


If you want to read it, clone project source files  and compile /src using latexmk.
