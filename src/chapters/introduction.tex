\label{sec:intro}
This Book was written for educational purposes for QA engineers in order to improve penetration testing skills.
Book is based on my own experience as well as books mentioned in reference section.
There are also applications and vulnerable systems attached to the file, it means that all instructions written below will be working on these systems.
Penetration testing is practically all about finding vulnerabilities and exploit them.
There are many tools presented in this text that allow you to scan the network, ports, protocols proceeding, as well as directly exploit the targets etc.
Remember that penetration testing techniques are not given recipe how to break or exploit software, they are rather abstractive templates that you need to understand, digest and consciously use.
