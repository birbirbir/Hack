\section{Mutillidae} Mutillidae is webpage build by OWASP team.
The webpage consist of many vulnerabilities and can be used for practising techniques.
In order to run Mutillidae download it from OWASP page.
Mutillidae folder consist of many PHP files, txt files and many others.
Copy the folder to your localhost htdocs folder (in my case /opt/lampp/htdocs).
Here I assumed you have already installed and configured XAMPP the newest version.
Dont mistake this XAMPP distro with the vulnerable one we installed for testing purposes.
Finally restart (or start) XAMPP by typing \texttt{./xampp start} (or restart).
Now you can use all Mutillidae features.
